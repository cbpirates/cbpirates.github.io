20th Jan, 2015 11:20 AM UTC  - Pingdom shows ~36 minutes downtime from 20-01-2015 11:20 AM UTC to 11:55 AM UTC. We had changed the content for the url used by pingdom to check the status but did not update the same in pingdom monitoring which resulted in pingdom indicating a downtime. There was no actual downtime during the period.
